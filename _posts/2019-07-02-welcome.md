I'm starting up a blog to discuss things I'm interested in and document my life. Things like programming and software tutorials, rock climbing reviews and how-to guides, book reviews, ultralight backpacking gear lists, trip documentaries, coffee reviews and random posts about my Corgi, Waffles.

Just to be clear, this isn't the first time I've tried to start one of these things. What's the betting line for if I write more than ten posts?
