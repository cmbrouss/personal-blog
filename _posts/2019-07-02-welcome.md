My name is Taylor Steinberg and this is my blog.

I have various hobbies and will be discussing those here. That may include backpacking, rock climbing, skateboard, and yoga.

Iâ€™m also a software engineer at LifeOmic and will sometimes post about public projects.

You can learn more about my hobbies and my professional life on my homepage [taylorsteinberg.com](https://taylorsteinberg.com).
